    Through an odd set of circumstances, you find yourself the Captain of a ship with a mission to deliver cargo through
    a hazardous stretch of sea strewn with icy rocks, icebergs and wandering tornadoes. You must deliver the cargo as
    quickly as possible to save on fuel.


</p>

<p>
    You are given a map of an icy sea as a square grid and quantity of fuel. You start in the north-west corner and you
    must deliver the cargo to the port in the south-eastern corner. The sea is filled with rocks and wandering magnetic
    tornadoes. These tornadoes are small, but dangerous and wander the sea seemingly at random. When your ship nears on,
    it will start to "chase" your ship due to its unusual magnetic properties. Tornadoes always take the shortest path
    but cannot pass through rocks. You should not sail into a tornado, strike icebergs or leave the map, else you spell
    a damp doom for yourself and your crew.
</p>

<p>
    The map is represented as a sequence of strings where "S" is your ship, "." is an empty cell, "X" is an iceberg and
    "O" is a tornado. For each step you should return an action as a string with one character. Actions: "N" is a move
    Northwards, "S" - South, "W" - West, "E" - East and "." waits for the turn. Tornadoes move simultaneously with the
    ship, so try to plan ahead and not sail into one.
</p>

<p>
    You have 100 units of fuel and each move uses one (even waiting). You should economize your fuel usage, because the
    points you earn depends on how much fuel you have remaining each game. If there is no fuel left in the ships
    reserves, then the ship will drift endlessly on the seas until the crew abandons her, triggering a game over.

</p>

<p>
    For this mission, you will be able to play the game until you get a game over. For each game you will receive points
    equal to the remaining fuel. If you crash, then you will receive 0 points for that game. The resulting score is the
    sum of scores for each game. Each game starts in a new environment.

    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. A sea map as a tuple of strings and remaining fuel as an integer.

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The action as a string.
